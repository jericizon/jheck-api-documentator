# Jheck Api Documentator

Hello! I'm just a lazy developer browsing for available online api document generator, but none of them fits on my taste. Most are not that easy to use or some requires you to register in able to use their service. I created this app to simplify the job by filling up the form fields and without even installing any complicated softwares to your local. Just export/import the file and you are ready to go!

## How to use it?
This app is free for use but you have to make sure your javascript and browser cookies are enabled. Just open App page then fill up all fields there.


## How to save it?
Data are stored using browser cookie for 1 day. There is also an export button to save it into `.json` file format that you will be able to import if you need it to.

## How i can preview the document?
Just navigate to Online Previewer to view your created document, or you can also use our import button to view your document.

## Experiencing errors?
Try to open your browser in incognito mode or clear your browser cookies, as this app uses cookie to save the data. If error still happen you can issue a ticket
